# Genetic Algorithm

<!DOCTYPE html>

This repository contains the genetic algorithm script developed to be used for the software part of the project I am working on.
The algorithm was inspired by the organization and pattern of running the genetic algorithm optimization process from the library called <a href="https://pygad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyGAD</a>, but
the code was developed separately to accommodate the needs of the project. <code>Genetic_Algorithm_Test.ipynb</code> provides a simple example where the algorithm is used
with a plot at the end for sanity check.
